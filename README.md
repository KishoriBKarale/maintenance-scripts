**Steps to use these hook files**

- 1. Copy config & pre-commit files into hooks folders located inside your local git clones

eg- If I have cloned `jbolo` git repo at location `/home/manoj/GIT/jbolo/` then hook folder is located at 
`/home/manoj/GIT/jbolo/.git/hooks`. Copy files into .git/hooks folder

- 2. Give executable permission to pre-commit file



That's it - you will start seeing php compilation & phpcs errors on every git commit itself.
